Twitter-Reviews
===============

This was a web app created at UC Berkeley's CalHacks 2014 hackathon.

It uses a twitter sentiment analysis library to analyze tweet history and determine if a person is a generally positive personality or negative personality person on Twitter.

It then generates advice on whether you should or should not befriend this person.

This was built on Python 2 with Flask as the web framework.
